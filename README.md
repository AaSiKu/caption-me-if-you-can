- This is the official repository for the BCS FAP (Freshers Amatuer Projects) - Caption me if you can
- Mentors of the project :
1. Sagar Arora (qu.bit)
2. Manasvi Nidugala (manasvi_nid)

- The aim of the project is to create an **Image caption generator** using basic CNNs and LSTMs.

This project will prove as an entry point for the mentees in the world of Machine Learning.

## Tentative timeline - 6 weeks

- Week 1 - Basics of Python, Python libraries like np, pd and ML(Introduction - train-test stuff, Libraries like TF, pytorch etc).
- Week 2 - Basics of  Machine Learning(Regression, Models, Small Tasks)
- Week 3 - Basics of Machine Learning (CNNs, RNNs, LSTM, Basic tasks)
- Week 4 - Project starts - Importing features from images using a pretrained VGG-16 model, processing & mapping captions.
- Week 5 - Training the model.
- Week 6 - Analysing Results and discussion on further improvements.


## Repo Setup 

It is highly advisable to learn basic tools like git and terminal commands as they'll prove they'll be useful in the future.
Resourced for terminal commands and git will be provided in [week1](week1.md).
